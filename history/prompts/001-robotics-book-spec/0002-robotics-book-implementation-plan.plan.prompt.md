## Prompt

create phr for these changes 

## Response snapshot

Completed comprehensive implementation plan for Physical and Humanoid Robotics Book with full constitution compliance. Resolved critical conflict between Mermaid diagram requirements and "No Visual Diagrams" constitution principle by prioritizing constitution compliance. Generated complete Phase 0 research decisions, Phase 1 design contracts, and Phase 2 file structure strategy.

Key deliverables created:
- research.md: All technical decisions documented (colors, favicon, Docusaurus config, dark mode)
- data-model.md: Content entities, relationships, and validation rules
- contracts/: Technical specifications for docusaurus-config, sidebar-structure, content-structure
- quickstart.md: Development setup and deployment guide
- plan.md: Updated with completed phases and next steps

Constitution compliance ensured:
- No visual diagrams (text-only explanations)
- Educational clarity with progressive learning
- Technical accuracy with citation requirements
- Modular Docusaurus structure
- Ethical and inclusive focus
- Sustainability emphasis
- Spec-driven development workflow
- Real-world application focus

Ready for implementation phase with docusaurus.config.js and sidesbars.js generation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete technical foundation for robotics book implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution compliance validated, all requirements addressed
- 📁 Files: 7 specification files created with detailed technical guidance
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to begin implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully resolved constitution conflict and established clear technical direction

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Branch switching requirements resolved by using opencode-ai as mandated
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All constitution principles addressed, technical decisions documented
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor implementation phase for any additional constitution compliance issues
