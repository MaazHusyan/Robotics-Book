## Prompt

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

User Input:
```
Project: Integrated RAG Chatbot Development for AI/Spec-Driven Book
Core principles:

Grounded responses: All answers generated by the chatbot must be strictly grounded in the book's content retrieved from the vector database (Qdrant) or explicitly provided user-selected text.
Accuracy and faithfulness: The chatbot must never hallucinate information not present in the retrieved contexts or selected text.
User-centric experience: The chatbot must be seamlessly embedded, responsive, and intuitive within the published Docusaurus book.
Privacy and security: No user conversation data is stored permanently unless explicitly required; sensitive keys and credentials are handled securely via environment variables only.
Reproducibility and maintainability: The entire RAG pipeline (ingestion, retrieval, generation) must be reproducible, version-controlled, and easy to update when book content changes.

Key standards:

Retrieval: Use Cohere embeddings stored in Qdrant Cloud Free Tier for similarity search; top-k ≥ 5 chunks with relevance threshold where applicable.
Generation: Use OpenAI models via Agents SDK or ChatKit; system prompt must enforce "answer only based on provided context" and include citation of sources.
Selected text mode: The chatbot must support a dedicated mode where answers are based solely on user-highlighted/selected text (passed as overriding or primary context).
Backend: FastAPI for API layer; Neon Serverless Postgres for any persistent metadata (e.g., conversation history if needed, user feedback, or analytics — optional but prepared).
Frontend integration: Use OpenAI ChatKit SDK where possible for the chat UI widget; fallback to custom React component in Docusaurus if needed.
Response format: Answers include inline citations (source page/section) when possible; streaming responses enabled.
Error handling: Graceful degradation (e.g., inform user if retrieval fails or no relevant content found).

Constraints:

Vector database: Qdrant Cloud Free Tier only (size and request limits respected).
Database: Neon Serverless Postgres (free/postgres-compatible tier).
No permanent storage of full user conversations unless explicitly opted-in.
Deployment: Backend must be deployable on free/reasonable-cost platforms (Render, Fly.io, Vercel, Railway, etc.).
Embedding model: Cohere (free tier or reasonable usage).
LLM: OpenAI models accessible via API (gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4o as primary).

Success criteria:

Chatbot correctly answers questions using only book content with verifiable citations.
Selected-text query mode works end-to-end: user highlights text → asks question → answer based solely on that selection.
Retrieval pipeline returns relevant chunks for typical book-related queries (tested with ≥ 20 sample questions).
Full system (ingestion → backend → frontend) runs without errors in production deployment.
Response latency acceptable (< 3s initial token for non-streaming, streaming starts quickly).
Zero hallucination in grounded mode (validated through manual review of test queries).
Code is clean, well-documented, and follows spec-driven patterns (Spec-Kit Plus compliant). 
```

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.
