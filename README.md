## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above
- Basic understanding of physics and programming concepts

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at `http://localhost:3000`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## 🌐 Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true npm deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
