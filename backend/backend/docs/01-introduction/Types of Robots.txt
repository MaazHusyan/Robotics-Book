## Introduction

Robots come in many shapes, sizes, and configurations, each designed for specific tasks and environments. Understanding robot classifications helps us appreciate the breadth of robotic applications and how different designs solve particular problems.

### Common Types

#### Articulated Arm Robots

Six-axis robotic arms are the workhorses of modern manufacturing:

```python
# Example: Industrial robot arm control
import numpy as np

class RobotArm:
    def __init__(self, joint_limits):
        self.joint_limits = joint_limits  # [min, max] for each joint
        self.current_position = np.zeros(6)  # 6 DOF arm
        
    def move_to_position(self, target_position):
        """Move arm to target position using inverse kinematics"""
        # Simplified inverse kinematics calculation
        self.current_position = self.ik_solver(target_position)
        return self.current_position
    
    def ik_solver(self, target):
        """Basic inverse kinematics solver"""
        # This would use actual IK algorithms in practice
        return target * 0.8  # Simplified for demonstration
```

### Major Categories

#### Domestic Service Robots

Home assistance robots for everyday tasks:

```cpp
// Example: Domestic service robot navigation
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class DomesticRobot {
private:
    std::vector<std::string> rooms;
    std::string current_location;
    
public:
    void addRoom(const std::string& room) {
        rooms.push_back(room);
    }
    
    bool navigateToRoom(const std::string& target_room) {
        // Simplified navigation logic
        for (const auto& room : rooms) {
            if (room == target_room) {
                current_location = target_room;
                std::cout << "Navigated to " << target_room << std::endl;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
